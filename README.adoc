= Dynamic Spring Cloud Gateway
:sectnums:

This application demonstrates a dynamic Spring Cloud Gateway with a REST controller to allow managing dynamic routes.

== Start the application

....
./gradlew bootRun
....

== Access the application

=== springdoc-ui

The REST API can be accessed via UI here:

== Example Micro-Service
:sectnums:

This separate example application is provided to demonstrate the routing of micro-services through the gateway.

=== Preparation
....
cd example-micro-service
....

=== Build the micro-service and its docker image
....
./gradlew clean build
docker-compose build
....

=== Start 4 configured instances of the micro-service
....
docker-compose up -d
....

These instances will respond on:

. http://localhost:10001/ -> micro-service1
. http://localhost:10002/ -> micro-service2
. http://localhost:10003/ -> micro-service3
. http://localhost:10004/ -> micro-service4

== Pre-configured routes in the gateway application

The gateway application provides the following pre-configured routes:

|===
|Micro Service  | Host URL                                                  | Gateway configuration       | Gateway URL
|micro-service1 | link:http://localhost:10001/[role=resource,window=_blank] | spring.cloud.gateway.routes                       | link:http://localhost:8080/micro-service1/[role=resource,window=_blank]
|micro-service2 | link:http://localhost:10002/[role=resource,window=_blank] | dynamic-routes              | link:http://localhost:8080/micro-service2/[role=resource,window=_blank]
|micro-service3 | link:http://localhost:10003/[role=resource,window=_blank] |                             |
|micro-service4 | link:http://localhost:10004/[role=resource,window=_blank] |                             |
|===

micro-service1 is configured in spring.cloud.gateway.routes cannot be managed at runtime.

All other routes are dynamic and can be managed at runtime.
